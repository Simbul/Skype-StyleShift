# StyleShift - enhanced style for Skype 5 Mac

## Why?

Because the new Skype chat is WebKit powered, and we enhanced it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to use

This is how:

* Download and open the ZIP file with the StyleShift style
* From inside your user folder open: ~/Library/Application Support/Skype/<yourname>/ChatStyles
* If the folder "ChatStyles" doesn't exist, create it
* Put inside ChatStyles the file "StyleShift.SkypeChatStyle" from the downloaded ZIP
* (Re)start Skype
* Go to Skype -> Preferences -> Messaging -> Style and choose "StyleShift"
* Restart Skype

To check that it's working, try pasting inside any chat an image URL ending with jpg/png/gif.
